# rainbow-hacking-SHA256
## simple code for final project of Introductory Python programming training course in Maktabkhoone
In the field of cybersecurity, password hashing is a fundamental practice to safeguard user credentials. One widely-used hashing algorithm is SHA-256, which is renowned for its cryptographic strength. However, in this project, we explore a scenario where an attacker attempts to reverse SHA-256 hashes of numeric passwords. Our project's primary aim is to create a Python program that can efficiently crack SHA-256 hashed numeric passwords.
